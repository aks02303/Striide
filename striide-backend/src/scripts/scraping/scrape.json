Given the potential for different trends over time across Boston, we adjusted crime rates according to citywide trends in order to better understand crime trajectories in different neighborhoods. We determine how the crime trajectories of individual census block groups compare to Boston\u2019s overall crime trend from 2011 to 2018 by allowing the relationship between year and crime to vary by block group using hierarchical linear models.\nIn this blog post, I will illustrate how crime trends vary across the city with maps of two types of crime, social disorder and the prevalence of guns, as measured by 911 calls from 2011 to 2018. The rate of public social disorder reflects the number of events that reflect social disorder in the public space (e.g. panhandling) per 1,000 people in the population. The rate of gun prevalence reflects the number of events that involve the use of guns (e.g. shootings) per 1,000 people in the population. In both cases, yearly population counts for census block groups were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, using the 5-year estimates with the median year matching the year of the ecometric. For example, for 2012 measures, the 2010-2014 ACS was used. Because the most recent release was the 2013-2017 ACS, this is used for all ecometrics for years 2015-2018. Across the two maps, it is evident that only some areas of Boston have notably different, either decreasing or increasing, crime trajectories as compared to the city overall.\nThe map above shows the trend from 2011 to 2018 in social disorder crime rates by census block group, in comparison to the Boston-wide trend over the same time period. The areas in green are block groups that have comparably notable decreasing trajectories in their rates of social disorder from 2011 to 2018. These areas include the Boston College area within Brighton, three areas near the Fens, and a few areas throughout Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, and West Roxbury. The decreasing trend in public social disorder in these areas, as compared to Boston in general, could be due to their more residential nature, in comparison to the areas of downtown Boston and Back Bay that are more likely to have a notably increasing trend. In addition to downtown, some areas of Charlestown, the North End, Chinatown, Roxbury, and Dorchester also have notably increasing trends of social disorder crime rates in relation to Boston overall.  However, more in-depth analyses would be useful in determining what factors relate to differing social disorder rate trajectories over time and whether these factors operate at the census block group level or at larger (e.g. neighborhood) or smaller (e.g. street) geographies.\nThe map above shows the trend from 2011 to 2018 in the prevalence of guns rates by census block group, in comparison to the Boston-wide trend over the same time period. In contrast to the social disorder trends, there are no census block groups that have notably decreasing trajectories in comparison to the overall citywide trend. This means that the majority of Boston\u2019s census block groups have a similar trajectory in comparison to Boston as a whole. However, similarly to social disorder, there are some areas that have a comparably notable increasing trajectory in the rates of the prevalence of guns. These areas are concentrated in Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester. Although these areas of Boston may be expected to have higher rates of gun prevalence given their history of high crime reports and their reputations for notable criminal activity, the map shows that the trajectory in this type of crime is statistically increasing when compared to the overall trend of the city of Boston. Therefore, these areas are particularly important in understanding Boston crime trends and the types of crime that are unique to certain areas.\nAs can be seen by comparing the two maps, only a few areas have notably increasing trajectories of both social disorder and prevalence of guns crime rates. Therefore, it seems that different types of crime have different trajectories over time across the city of Boston.  Because gun crimes are rare overall, an area with a downward trajectory compared to the city is unlikely, whereas social disorder is much more common and clusters around business districts and similar areas.  In improving crime trajectories toward the city trend, or even better than it, it is vital to consider factors that may affect types of crime differentially and address underlying issues accordingly.\nFor more on the 911 data, the data and documentation can be found here.

Colonial Boston played a key role in the founding of the United States, and the city currently plays a major role in the culture and economy of the New England region. With many reasons to live in Boston, the safety question is a common concern. To make the most of visiting or relocating, we\u2019ve compiled a list of the twelve most dangerous places to live in Boston.\n12 Most Dangerous Neighborhoods in Boston\nCentral \nRoxbury\nSouth End\nNorth Dorchester \nSouth Dorchester\nMattapan\nBack Bay-Beacon Hill\nChelsea\nChinatown\nSouth Boston\nHyde Park\nJamaica Plain\n1. Central\nThe most dangerous neighborhood in Boston is Central. Although this area is in the heart of the city and has a population of around 33,000 residents, it is considered the worst part of Boston. Central\u2019s violent crime rate is exorbitantly high, being 321% higher than the national average. Despite its high crime rate, Central has multiple tourist attractions, including museums, arenas, and plenty of historical sites. Being located in Boston proper, Central benefits from being a convenient location. \n2. Roxbury \nRoxbury is another one of the most dangerous Boston neighborhoods. This area of Boston is known for having a high rate of violent crimes, gang activity, and property crime. With a population of 63,672, Roxbury has a crime rate that is 237% higher than the Massachusetts average. In addition, much of this neighborhood has fallen victim to disrepair and urban decay, with some parts of the neighborhood being revitalized. \n3. South End\nSouth End is another one of the worst areas in Boston for crime. South End has a population of 34,304 and a crime rate that is 169% higher than the state average. South End doesn\u2019t have a high violent crime rate, but property crime occurs often. Residents are advised to not keep personal belongings in their cars as they are often broken into. Despite having a high crime rate, the average home price in South End is still $568,400. \n4. North Dorchester \nNorth Dorchester has a population of 27,791 and a crime rate that is 156% higher than the national average. North Dorchester is a relatively low-income area with poorly rated schools and below-average employment options. Violent crime remains somewhat of a problem, with property crimes such as theft and vehicle theft being the most common. \n5. South Dorchester\nSouth Dorchester is a dangerous Boston neighborhood with a total crime rate of 3,295 per 100,000, which is 142% higher than the Massachusetts state average. While violent crime does occur in this neighborhood, most of the crime is related to property crime. However, violent crime is still prevalent, with assaults and robberies happening sporadically. It is advised to stay aware of your surroundings and use common sense if you are passing through South Dorchester. \n6. Mattapan\nMattapan has a population of 39,010 and a crime rate that is 141% higher than the state average, making it one of the worst neighborhoods in Boston for crime. Mattapan has a high property crime rate, with theft, car break-ins, and larceny being common. Despite this, Mattapan is considered to be an up-and-coming neighborhood that is undergoing revitalization. Much of Mattapan\u2019s housing remains public housing and small residential buildings. \n7. Back Bay-Beacon Hill\nBack Bay is a historic waterfront neighborhood known for its rows of Victorian brownstone houses. While crime may not be the largest concern for residents, Back Bay still has a crime rate that is 141% higher than the Massachusetts state average. However, most of this is property crimes such as car break-ins, vehicle theft, and other petty crimes. Back Bay is a relatively affluent community with a median income of $61,578 and a median home price of $352,652.\n8. Chelsea\nChelsea is another dangerous area in Boston. Situated directly across the Mystic River from Boston, Chelsea is a city that\u2019s home to about 40,000 residents. It\u2019s the second most densely populated city in Massachusetts after Somerville. Chelsea is famous for its historic buildings and authentic restaurants. However, it\u2019s also one of the more dangerous parts of the Boston area. The violent crime rate in Chelsea is 117% higher than the national average and 17% higher than the rest of Boston. It\u2019s more dangerous than 90% of US cities, and your odds of being the victim of a crime in Chelsea are 1 in 39. \n9. Chinatown\nChinatown is another dangerous Boston neighborhood. Considered a part of downtown Boston, Chinatown is a lively neighborhood known for its delicious dumpling houses and nightlife venues. It\u2019s one of Boston\u2019s most densely populated neighborhoods and it\u2019s one of the largest Chinatowns in the US, outside of New York City. Although not the most dangerous city in Boston, Chinatown does feature a violent crime rate that is significantly higher than the national average. The violent crime rate in Boston\u2019s Chinatown is 691 crimes per 100,000 residents, which is 39% higher than the rest of the country.\n10. South Boston\nSouth Boston is also one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Boston. South Boston is a relatively affluent area with access to ports, downtown, and entertainment options. Residents are advised to watch out for car theft and petty crime, and usually, this can be avoided if proper caution is used. Much of the existing criminal element in this neighborhood is being driven out by rising rent and home prices. \n11. Hyde Park\nHyde Park is a dangerous Boston neighborhood that is situated just 7.9 miles south of Downtown. Although Hyde Park has a violent crime rate that is 20% higher than the national average, it is considered relatively safe when it comes to violent crime. Most of the crimes in Hyde Park are property crimes, with the most common types of crime being theft and burglaries. However, assaults are not uncommon, so you should always be aware of your surroundings in the neighborhood. Hyde Park still attracts many visitors and residents, with a median home price of $324,484. \n12. Jamaica Plain\nJamaica Plain is another dangerous Boston neighborhood. It has a population of 45,158 and a crime rate that is 36% higher than the Massachusetts average. Jamaica Plain has been revitalized in recent years, with many older homes being rebuilt. The violent crime rate in this neighborhood is mostly assaults, with thefts and burglaries occurring sporadically. \nJoin our mailing list\nJoin\nFeatured Posts\nBiden's $25,000 Down Payment Toward Equity Act Guide\nMost Dangerous Cities in America\nCheapest Places to Live in Florida\nNYC Income Tax Guide\nStates With No Property Taxes on Homes\n15 Most Dangerous States in the US\nMore from the blog\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in Seattle\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in New Orleans\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in Los Angeles\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in Baltimore\nCelebrities That Live In Naples, Florida\nUpper East Side vs Upper West Side\nCelebrities Who Live in Palm Beach Florida\nBuying a Used Lawnmower Guide\n\u00a9 PropertyClub 2024Terms|Privacy|Contact Us: contact@propertyclub.nyc", "Reports\nMatch\nCreate\nSubscribe\nor\nLog In\n\n\n\n\n\nData on this report is based on areas within the legal city boundary, outlined in black on the map.

While it serves as the economic and cultural center of the New England region of the Northeastern United States, one should consider the safest areas and the cost of living in Boston before deciding to move there. \nWhile living in Boston is generally safe, certain neighborhoods or areas in Boston are safer than others. \nAre you looking for a neighborhood in or right out of Boston where you can feel safe? MovingWaldo got you covered! Here\u2019s the list of the Top 7 Safest Neighborhoods in Boston with the Best Quality of Life \u2013 2024!\nMethodology\nOur ranking methodology is based on a careful analysis of crime rates derived from Massachusetts Crime Statistics 2022. To ensure accuracy, we calculated the average number of various crimes per 1000 people; the data is categorized into three groups: crimes against persons, crimes against society offenses, and crimes against property offenses.\nThe \u201cBest quality of life\u201d aspect is measured based on feedback from real people who have moved to this area in our database or real people from trusted online forums. More specifically, we generally look for positive feedback on job opportunities, quality of education, quality of healthcare, feeling of safety, public transportation, environment (cleanliness), as well as availability of recreational facilities and parks.\nAd\nSafest Neighborhoods to Live in Boston\n1.

Irons, Globe Staff\n\nThe divide between the haves and have-nots in Boston has always been stark, often measured by the quality of schools and the safety of streets.\nBut a new city analysis underscores a basic disparity that is often overlooked, though it\u2019s in plain sight: Residents in the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods \u2014 Roxbury, Mattapan, and parts of Dorchester \u2014 are much more likely to contend with buckled asphalt, cracking concrete, and tree roots smashing through their sidewalks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like this ever since I moved here [three years ago],\u2019\u2019 Frank Pina said, as he looked down at the spiderweb cracks in the sidewalk outside his home near Warren Street in Grove Hall. He said he has not called the city for repairs because \u201cnothing would get done.\u2019\u2019\nIndeed, sidewalks are part of the city\u2019s legacy of neglect in low-income neighborhoods. In Grove Hall, which straddles Roxbury and Dorchester, residents are also beset by large potholes and litter piling up in a field next to a deteriorating post office. Residents who call City Hall for repairs soon grow weary of the slow grind of bureaucracy, so they endure, advocates said.\n\u201cThey think the city isn\u2019t going to do anything about it,\u2019\u2019 said Ed Gaskin, who runs the Greater Grove Hall Main Streets program, an advocacy group tasked with getting basic neighborhood amenities \u2014 such as crosswalks, sidewalks, and street lights \u2014 installed or fixed.\nAs a result, recent data show, sidewalks in some of the city\u2019s low-income neighborhoods are often among the most damaged.\nSixty-five percent of the sidewalks in Roxbury and Dorchester are either in fair or poor condition; by contrast, 68 percent of the sidewalks downtown and in the Back Bay are in good condition, city data show.\nResidents said they have good reasons to be skeptical of the city\u2019s commitment to basic neighborhood improvements. For example, Robert Hector, a retired engineer who has lived in Grove Hall for nearly 30 years, said he made about a half-dozen calls to the city to replace a \u201cWelcome to Grove Hall\u2019\u2019 sign that was knocked down by a car about a decade ago. After much pushing, it was replaced about three years ago, he said.\nBut the city may finally be taking notice. Following a 1,600-mile sidewalk review last year, Chris Osgood, the city\u2019s chief of the streets, transportation, and sanitation, said Boston will be taking on sidewalk equity with a systematic approach to repairs and investing $2 million in this spring\u2019s capital budget to reconstruct sidewalks on various streets crossing Humboldt Avenue, which stretches from Franklin Park to near Dudley Square.\n\u201cOne of the things that we . . . identified is that the underlying condition of the sidewalks was actually quite different across the neighborhoods,\u2019\u2019 Osgood said.\nBoston is also a finalist for a $1 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies to support the city\u2019s plans to \u201cinfuse equity\u2019\u2019 in its allocation of resources for sidewalk and street maintenance. The goal is to augment 311 dispatch requests with data on community need, pavement condition, and usage, officials said.\nThe city began taking a closer look at sidewalk equity last year after the issue was raised in a 154-page report from Mayor Martin J. Walsh\u2019s Office of Resilience and Racial Equity. The document urged the city to rethink how it repairs and maintains sidewalks and develop a proactive, systematic approach in allocating resources.\nTypically, city crews are dispatched to do spot repairs based in part on residents\u2019 complaints to the city \u2014 either through its 311 hot line or neighborhood services \u2014 fixing the problems as they arise.\nBut city officials said in targeting sidewalk equity, they did not use 311 calls because some neighborhoods use the hot line roughly twice as often as others do. Officials said relying on such data would give a false notion of which neighborhoods or streets need work.\nInstead, a city crew went block by block last year to assess Boston\u2019s 1,600 miles of sidewalks. The crew analyzed blocks needing sidewalk repair, the shape they were in, and whether they were compliant with the Americans for Disability Act, said Katie Choe, the city\u2019s chief engineer and director of construction management.\nThe crew assessed the condition of each sidewalk by the total surface area damaged, rather than the severity of damage, and then mapped out the poorest sidewalk conditions in the most disadvantaged areas.\n\u201cThose were the areas where we need to put some special investments into,\u2019\u2019 Choe said.\nThe city\u2019s sidewalk budget last year was $6.1 million, and the sidewalk equity analysis cost $39,600, officials said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that the city uses an equity lens\u2019\u2019 on these issues, said City Councilor Kim Janey, who represents Roxbury. \u201cResidents don\u2019t always know who to call. And the city can\u2019t always respond to the squeaky wheel.\u2019\u2019\nJamie Mitchell, a barber who owns Mattapan\u2019s Finest barbershop, said the sidewalks equity project is long overdue. He noted that the city repaired the sidewalks outside his Blue Hill Avenue store last year but said there are plenty of other stretches that need maintenance.\nThe sidewalks, he noted, are a fraction of the issues plaguing Grove Hall, where he lives. For example, he and other business owners have been trying to get security cameras installed to monitor loitering and what they say are illegal activities at a municipal lot behind their businesses. They have held meetings with city officials, but talks have dragged on, he said. And there are still no cameras.\n\u201cThey are not giving Roxbury . . . as much [improvements] as they are giving other neighborhoods,\u2019\u2019 Mitchell said.\nGaskin said that when he started advocating in the neighborhood, he and residents had to push the city to get 13 street lights replaced, a new crosswalk near a busy school, banners, and new sidewalks. On one occasion, Gaskin said, he took some city officials on a walk through the neighborhood, and one of them noticed a tree root bursting through and fracturing the sidewalk.\nHe said the mayor kept his promise to give Grove Hall renewed attention: There are new sidewalks along Grove Hall center and the Warren Street and Elm Hill neighborhoods. The sidewalks on Warren Street and Blue Hill Avenue are now compliant with the Americans with Disability Act. And Grove Hall is no longer in the dark, with new street lights. There is a new crosswalk near a busy school and bike racks and fences, he said.\nBut for other things, the neighborhood is still waiting.\n\u201cThe sidewalk near the post office [on Warren] is all asphalt,\u2019\u2019 Gaskin said. \u201cI\u2019ve been asking to get it fixed. I\u2019m still waiting for it to get done.\u2019\u2019\nIrfan Uraizee of the Globe staff contributed to this report. Meghan E.

Colonial Boston played a key role in the founding of the United States, and the city currently plays a major role in the culture and economy of the New England region. With many reasons to live in Boston, the safety question is a common concern. To make the most of visiting or relocating, we\u2019ve compiled a list of the twelve most dangerous places to live in Boston.\n12 Most Dangerous Neighborhoods in Boston\nCentral \nRoxbury\nSouth End\nNorth Dorchester \nSouth Dorchester\nMattapan\nBack Bay-Beacon Hill\nChelsea\nChinatown\nSouth Boston\nHyde Park\nJamaica Plain\n1. Central\nThe most dangerous neighborhood in Boston is Central. Although this area is in the heart of the city and has a population of around 33,000 residents, it is considered the worst part of Boston. Central\u2019s violent crime rate is exorbitantly high, being 321% higher than the national average. Despite its high crime rate, Central has multiple tourist attractions, including museums, arenas, and plenty of historical sites. Being located in Boston proper, Central benefits from being a convenient location. \n2. Roxbury \nRoxbury is another one of the most dangerous Boston neighborhoods. This area of Boston is known for having a high rate of violent crimes, gang activity, and property crime. With a population of 63,672, Roxbury has a crime rate that is 237% higher than the Massachusetts average. In addition, much of this neighborhood has fallen victim to disrepair and urban decay, with some parts of the neighborhood being revitalized. \n3. South End\nSouth End is another one of the worst areas in Boston for crime. South End has a population of 34,304 and a crime rate that is 169% higher than the state average. South End doesn\u2019t have a high violent crime rate, but property crime occurs often. Residents are advised to not keep personal belongings in their cars as they are often broken into. Despite having a high crime rate, the average home price in South End is still $568,400. \n4. North Dorchester \nNorth Dorchester has a population of 27,791 and a crime rate that is 156% higher than the national average. North Dorchester is a relatively low-income area with poorly rated schools and below-average employment options. Violent crime remains somewhat of a problem, with property crimes such as theft and vehicle theft being the most common. \n5. South Dorchester\nSouth Dorchester is a dangerous Boston neighborhood with a total crime rate of 3,295 per 100,000, which is 142% higher than the Massachusetts state average. While violent crime does occur in this neighborhood, most of the crime is related to property crime. However, violent crime is still prevalent, with assaults and robberies happening sporadically. It is advised to stay aware of your surroundings and use common sense if you are passing through South Dorchester. \n6. Mattapan\nMattapan has a population of 39,010 and a crime rate that is 141% higher than the state average, making it one of the worst neighborhoods in Boston for crime. Mattapan has a high property crime rate, with theft, car break-ins, and larceny being common. Despite this, Mattapan is considered to be an up-and-coming neighborhood that is undergoing revitalization. Much of Mattapan\u2019s housing remains public housing and small residential buildings. \n7. Back Bay-Beacon Hill\nBack Bay is a historic waterfront neighborhood known for its rows of Victorian brownstone houses. While crime may not be the largest concern for residents, Back Bay still has a crime rate that is 141% higher than the Massachusetts state average. However, most of this is property crimes such as car break-ins, vehicle theft, and other petty crimes. Back Bay is a relatively affluent community with a median income of $61,578 and a median home price of $352,652.\n8. Chelsea\nChelsea is another dangerous area in Boston. Situated directly across the Mystic River from Boston, Chelsea is a city that\u2019s home to about 40,000 residents. It\u2019s the second most densely populated city in Massachusetts after Somerville. Chelsea is famous for its historic buildings and authentic restaurants. However, it\u2019s also one of the more dangerous parts of the Boston area. The violent crime rate in Chelsea is 117% higher than the national average and 17% higher than the rest of Boston. It\u2019s more dangerous than 90% of US cities, and your odds of being the victim of a crime in Chelsea are 1 in 39. \n9. Chinatown\nChinatown is another dangerous Boston neighborhood. Considered a part of downtown Boston, Chinatown is a lively neighborhood known for its delicious dumpling houses and nightlife venues. It\u2019s one of Boston\u2019s most densely populated neighborhoods and it\u2019s one of the largest Chinatowns in the US, outside of New York City. Although not the most dangerous city in Boston, Chinatown does feature a violent crime rate that is significantly higher than the national average. The violent crime rate in Boston\u2019s Chinatown is 691 crimes per 100,000 residents, which is 39% higher than the rest of the country.\n10. South Boston\nSouth Boston is also one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Boston. South Boston is a relatively affluent area with access to ports, downtown, and entertainment options. Residents are advised to watch out for car theft and petty crime, and usually, this can be avoided if proper caution is used. Much of the existing criminal element in this neighborhood is being driven out by rising rent and home prices. \n11. Hyde Park\nHyde Park is a dangerous Boston neighborhood that is situated just 7.9 miles south of Downtown. Although Hyde Park has a violent crime rate that is 20% higher than the national average, it is considered relatively safe when it comes to violent crime. Most of the crimes in Hyde Park are property crimes, with the most common types of crime being theft and burglaries. However, assaults are not uncommon, so you should always be aware of your surroundings in the neighborhood. Hyde Park still attracts many visitors and residents, with a median home price of $324,484. \n12. Jamaica Plain\nJamaica Plain is another dangerous Boston neighborhood. It has a population of 45,158 and a crime rate that is 36% higher than the Massachusetts average. Jamaica Plain has been revitalized in recent years, with many older homes being rebuilt. The violent crime rate in this neighborhood is mostly assaults, with thefts and burglaries occurring sporadically. \nJoin our mailing list\nJoin\nFeatured Posts\nBiden's $25,000 Down Payment Toward Equity Act Guide\nMost Dangerous Cities in America\nCheapest Places to Live in Florida\nNYC Income Tax Guide\nStates With No Property Taxes on Homes\n15 Most Dangerous States in the US\nMore from the blog\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in Seattle\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in New Orleans\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in Los Angeles\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in Baltimore\nCelebrities That Live In Naples, Florida\nUpper East Side vs Upper West Side\nCelebrities Who Live in Palm Beach Florida\nBuying a Used Lawnmower Guide\n\u00a9 PropertyClub 2024Terms|Privacy|Contact Us: contact@propertyclub.nyc", "Livability\n\u00a9 Proximitii\n\u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors\n\u00a9 OpenMapTiles\nLeaflet\n3 km\n2 mi\n+\n\u2212\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods In Boston, MA\nPrioritizing safety is essential when contemplating a move to a new location. There are certain areas to avoid in Boston, as they exhibit higher than normal crime rates. Routine activities like walking alone at night or leaving vehicles unattended can inadvertently trigger criminal acts, particularly in neighborhoods considered high-risk. Boston serves as an illustrative case of a city grappling with such concerns, primarily due to its expansive size and high population density. Drawing from recent crime data, we've compiled a list of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Boston for 2024. These rankings are predicated on the incidence of violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and assault) per 100,000 residents in each neighborhood, juxtaposed against the city's overall violent crime average. Our identification of the most worst neighborhoods in Boston is grounded in crime data furnished by the local law enforcement agency, supplemented by demographic data estimates where official statistics are unavailable.\nRecognizing the human toll behind each statistic is paramount. Violent crime affects individuals and families profoundly. These rankings of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Boston serve not only to identify areas requiring urgent attention but also to mobilize collective efforts for the safety and welfare of all Boston residents. Through collaboration among locals, Boston can aspire to create neighborhoods characterized by security, resilience and opportunity. Addressing urban safety demands a holistic approach, going beyond mere statistical analysis to tackle socio-economic disparities and enhance community-police partnerships. By fostering inclusivity and empowerment, Boston can shape a safer, more promising future for all its residents.\nCENTRAL\nPOPULATION\n33,579\n137%\nVIOLENT CRIMES\n1,468 crimes / 100k people\n137% more crime than Boston\nROXBURY\nPOPULATION\n58,696\n88%\nVIOLENT CRIMES\n1,162 crimes / 100k people\n88% more crime than Boston\nSOUTH END\nPOPULATION\n33,120\n40%\nVIOLENT CRIMES\n864 crimes / 100k people\n40% more crime than Boston\nMATTAPAN\nPOPULATION\n42,727\n34%\nVIOLENT CRIMES\n829 crimes / 100k people\n34% more crime than Boston\nSOUTH DORCHESTER\nPOPULATION\n68,359\n25%\nVIOLENT CRIMES\n773 crimes / 100k people\n25% more crime than Boston\nNORTH DORCHESTER\nPOPULATION\n26,430\n10%\nVIOLENT CRIMES\n678 crimes / 100k people\n10% more crime than Boston\nBACK BAY-BEACON HILL\nPOPULATION\n28,988\n-13%\nVIOLENT CRIMES\n537 crimes / 100k people\n13% less crime than Boston\nSOUTH BOSTON\nPOPULATION\n41,090\n-27%\nVIOLENT CRIMES\n449 crimes / 100k people\n27% less crime than Boston\nHYDE PARK\nPOPULATION\n38,370\n-32%\nVIOLENT CRIMES\n419 crimes / 100k people\n32% less crime than Boston\nJAMAICA PLAIN\nPOPULATION\n47,098\n-33%\nVIOLENT CRIMES\n416 crimes / 100k people\n33% less crime than Boston\nBoston Neighborhoods\n\nBest Neighborhoods in Boston for Singles\n\nBest Neighborhoods in Boston for Families\n\nSafest Neighborhoods in Boston\n\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in Boston\n\nMost Affordable Neighborhoods in Boston\n\nMost Expensive Neighborhoods in Boston\nNew Real Estate Listings in Boston Area\nFor Sale\nFor Rent\n$0\n$50K\n$100K\n$150K\n$200K\n$250K\n$300K\n$350K\n$400K\n$450K\n$500K\n$600K\n$700K\n$800K\n$900K\n$1M\n$1.25M\n$1.5M\n$2M\n$3M\n$4M\n$5M\n$10M\n$20M\n$50K\n$100K\n$150K\n$200K\n$250K\n$300K\n$350K\n$400K\n$450K\n$500K\n$600K\n$700K\n$800K\n$900K\n$1M\n$1.25M\n$1.5M\n$2M\n$3M\n$4M\n$5M\n$10M\n$20M\nNo Max\nBedrooms\n1+ Bedrooms\n2+ Bedrooms\n3+ Bedrooms\n4+ Bedrooms\nBathrooms\n1+ Bathrooms\n2+ Bathrooms\n3+ Bathrooms\n4+ Bathrooms\nSearch\nSearch Homes for Sale in Boston, MA\nGeneral\nAbout Us\nMethodology\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nContact Us\nFor Professionals\nWidgets\nAPI\nFollow Us\nAV on Twitter AV on Facebook \u00a9 AreaVibes Inc. 2010-2024", "Jump to content\nMain menu\nSearch\nCreate account\nLog in\nPersonal tools\nContents hide\n(Top)\nGeographic history\nToggle Geographic history subsection\nSubdistricts\nParks\nHistory\nToggle History subsection\nResidential history\nUrban renewal\nJazz\nEducation\nCommunity resources\nToggle Community resources subsection\nDiversity\n2010 census\nPublic transportation\nGallery\nToggle Gallery subsection\n1950s\nContemporary images\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nSouth End, Boston\n6 languages\nArticle\nTalk\nRead\nEdit\nView history\nTools\nAppearance hide\nText\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\nWidth\nStandard\nWide\nCoordinates: 42\u00b020\u203237.86\u2033N 71\u00b04\u203218.71\u2033W\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nNot to be confused with South Boston.\nSouth End District\nU.S. National Register of Historic Places\nLocation in Boston\nShow map of Boston\nShow map of Greater Boston area\nShow map of Massachusetts\nShow map of the United States\nShow all\nLocation Boston, Massachusetts\nArchitect Multiple\nArchitectural style Greek Revival, Late Victorian, Italianate\nWebsite www.south-end-boston.com\nNRHP reference No. 73000324[1]\nAdded to NRHP May 8, 1973\nThe South End is a neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, United States which is bordered by Back Bay, Chinatown, and Roxbury. It is distinguished from other neighborhoods by its Victorian-style houses and the parks in and around the area. The South End is the largest intact Victorian row-house district in the country, covering over 300 acres (120 ha).[2] It has eleven residential parks. In 1973, the South End was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[2] Much of the neighborhood was originally marshlands in Boston's South Bay. After it was filled in, construction began in 1849.\nIt is home to diverse groups, including immigrants, young families and professionals, and it is popular with Boston's gay and lesbian community.[3] The South End has been characterized by diversity since the 1880s, with substantial Irish, Jewish, African-American, Puerto Rican (in the San Juan Street area), Chinese, Italian, and Greek populations. Its 2010 population was 55.2 percent white, 13.3 percent Hispanic, 12.5 percent Black, 16.2 percent Asian, and 2.7 percent \"other\". 55.2 percent of South End residents had a bachelor's degree or higher; median household income was $57,699, and the median age was 36. 65.6 percent were primarily English speakers, and 12.9 percent primarily spoke Spanish.[4]\nGeographic history[edit]\nAerial view of the South End\nThe Boston Neck carried present-day Washington Street, formerly flanked by tidal marshes.\nThe South End is south of the Back Bay, northwest of South Boston, northeast of Roxbury, north of Dorchester, and southwest of Bay Village. Despite the name, it is not directly south of downtown Boston.\nLand belonging to the South End has been part of the city of Boston since its founding, although it was smaller when first settled and surrounded by large tidal flats.[5] The neighborhood was expanded and developed by filling in the marshlands, part of a larger project of filling Boston's Back Bay and South Bay between the 1830s and the 1870s.[5] Fill was brought in by train as gravel quarried in Needham.[5] Nineteenth-century technology did not allow driving steel piles into bedrock, and a system of submerged timbers provided an understructure for most South End buildings.[6][7] Groundwater levels in Boston had been dropping for years by 2006, damaging some wood pilings by exposing them to air.[7][8] A series of monitoring wells have been drilled; the water level is checked by the Boston Groundwater Trust,[9] and can be raised by introducing water.[7]\nThe South End was bordered on the north and west by the Boston and Providence Railroad,[10] which terminated at the B&PRR station bordering the Public Garden. The rail line is now covered by Southwest Corridor Park.[11]\nThe primary business thoroughfares in the South End are Columbus Avenue, Tremont Street, and Washington Street. Washington Street, the original causeway that connected Roxbury to Boston, experienced reinvestment during the 1990s. The street was once defined by the Washington Street Elevated, an elevated train that was moved below Southwest Corridor Park in the 1980s.[12][13] Part of the Silver Line, Boston's first bus rapid transit line, runs along Washington Street.[14] The MBTA Orange Line rapid-transit train runs along the partially-covered Southwest Corridor.[12]\nSubdistricts[edit]\nThe Boston Redevelopment Authority identified several subdistricts in the neighborhood's southeast portion:[15]\nSoWa (South of Washington), roughly between Albany to Washington and East Berkeley to Massachusetts Avenue\nNew York Streets, between Herald, East Berkeley, Albany, and Tremont Streets\nBack Streets, roughly between I-93, Harrison, East Brookline, and East Berkeley Streets\nMedical area, roughly between the highway, Massachusetts Avenue, Franklin Square, and East Brookline Street\nParks[edit]\nThe South End has eleven residential parks, varying in size and inspired by English-style residential squares first laid out downtown by Charles Bulfinch. The neighborhood also has newer parks, including Peters Park, and a series of sixteen community gardens and pocket parks operated by the Trustees of Reservations.\nHistory[edit]\nResidential history[edit]\nThe Alexandra Hotel in 1899\nAs the South End expanded with fill north and west of \"the Neck\", Boston envisioned a large inner-city residential neighborhood to relieve the crowded downtown and Beacon Hill neighborhoods and hoped for a large, stable tax base. Architect Charles Bulfinch laid out some of the first filled land.[16] He designed a large residential park called Columbia Square[16] located at the present Franklin and Blackstone Squares.[17] Bulfinch's plan was to route traffic around the square. His plan was abandoned, and Washington Street was allowed to again divide the square (creating separate squares).[16]\nMany rooming houses on the Back Bay side of the South End had no bathing facilities, and roomers bathed in public showers. Filled land in the neighborhood was originally eight feet above sea level, but has settled to four feet. The original shoreline of Boston Neck crosses in front of 40 St. George Street, and tapers to the narrowest point of the Neck at Dover Street. Blackstone and Franklin Square is solid land on the original neck, but clam and snail shells are just beneath its surface because high seas would occasionally overrun the Neck.\nMiddle-class people moved to the South End, including business owners, two mayors, bankers, and industrialists, but the neighborhood's wealthy status was relatively short-lived. A series of national financial panics such as the Panic of 1884, combined with new residential housing in Back Bay and Roxbury, fed a steady decline of whites of English Protestant ancestry.\nBy the close of the nineteenth century, the South End was becoming a tenement district; it attracted immigrants and, during the 1940s, gay men. The neighborhood also became a center of Black middle-class Boston life and culture. The largest concentration of Pullman porters in the country lived in the South End, primarily between Columbus Avenue and the railroad.\nThe first settlement houses in Boston were in the South End: the South End House, Haley House, Lincoln House, the Harriet Tubman House, and the Children's Art Centre. In 1960, these settlement houses merged to form United South End Settlements.[18]\nUrban renewal[edit]\nUnion Park Street and Shawmut Avenue\nColumbus Avenue\nThe South End was one of many large-scale Boston landfill projects to create new residential districts.[2] Construction began in 1849, on tidal marshes that surrounded Boston Neck.[2] The street plan for the South End was patterned on 18th-century English models, with blocks of townhouses overlooking small parks in the centers of residential streets.[2] The parks were built to make the neighborhood feel more like a community.[2] Townhouses quickly became the predominant form of housing, and builders produced blocks of houses for middle-class families.[2] The townhouses were built from 1850 to 1880, typically in a mix of architectural styles.[2] The South End became a popular hospital district; the first was Boston City Hospital, which attracted other hospitals to the area.[2] One was the Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital, built in 1875.[2] The hospital used fresh-air cures and home remedies on patients, and surgical cases were sent to the Boston University School of Medicine.[2] The medical school came to the South End in 1874 with the New England Female College, the first college in the region to accept women.[2] By the late 19th century, the South End was becoming increasingly populated by African Americans from the South.[2] Although City Hospital admitted Black patients, they were not allowed in their training programs or hired as professionals.[2] Cornelius Garland, a Black physician from Alabama, opened Plymouth Hospital and Nurse's Training School by 1908.[2] By 1929, Plymouth Hospital was closed because City Hospital had begun to accept people of color into its medical and nursing programs.[2]\nThe connection of Boston and Albany by railroad (by some of the various companies that would later merge into the Boston and Albany Railroad) was celebrated in 1841 as a way to keep Boston competitive with New York City as an Atlantic port. The New York Streets district, a residential area of the South End whose streets were named after cities on the route to Albany, arose south of the Boston and Worcester Railroad (the present-day Massachusetts Turnpike) over the next decade. Albany Street still exists, although it now ends at the turnpike instead of Kneeland; connecting it with Harrison Street from north to south were Seneca, Oneida, Oswego, Genesee, Rochester and Troy Streets. Troy is the present-day Traveler Street.[19][20][21]\nNearly all the buildings in New York Streets began to be bulldozed in 1955 as part of an urban renewal project to clear slums and make room for industrial activity during a period characterized by urban decline. The resulting superblock was redeveloped into the headquarters of the Boston Herald.[19] The Herald-Traveler Corporation extended from the new Herald Street to Traveler Street until 2012, when it moved to the Seaport District in South Boston.[22] It was redeveloped as a mixed-use area known as the Ink Block, with apartments, a grocery store, restaurants, and other retail businesses.[19] Other populated sites in the South End received similar treatment, particularly the early high-rise, high-density Cathedral Housing Projects adjacent to Holy Cross Cathedral and high- and low-rise redevelopments such as Castle Square, from 1964 to 1966.[23]\nThe South End is residential and commercial. Since it is near access to railroads and port facilities, it attracted a number of manufacturers.[2] Albany Street, along the Roxbury Canal, became occupied by warehouses and factories and was the center of Boston's furniture and piano-making industry by the 19th century.[2] The South End has new developments that will add residential and commercial space. According to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), a new project will be built on Albany Street which will \"include two hotels: a 16-story select service hotel, which will have a restaurant on its first floor; and a 9-story extended-stay hotel. The hotels together will have approximately 408 rooms. While the split between the two types of hotels has not been finally determined, current plans anticipate approximately 210 rooms in the select service hotel and approximately 198 rooms in the extended-stay hotel. The select-service hotel will include an approximately 4,000 square-foot (approximately 267-seat) restaurant on its first floor. A 3-level, above-ground parking garage with approximately 137 parking spaces will serve both hotels.\"[24] The project was expected to provide about 200 new jobs for construction workers and \"employ approximately 200 employees (full-time equivalents) in management, operations, customer service, retail, and food service functions.\"[24]\nJazz[edit]\nBraddock Park\nUntil the 1950s, the South End and nearby Roxbury was a jazz mecca with clubs such as the Royal Palms, Eddie Levine's, the Pioneer Club, Handy's Grille, Tic-Toc, Connolly's, Estelle's, the Hi-Hat, The Savoy, The Cave, Basin Street, Louie's Lounge, and Wally's Paradise; Wally's is the only club still in operation. The American Federation of Musicians Local 535 was the top black musicians' union in the country from 1915 to 1970, with local and national musicians including Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Chick Webb, Earl Hines, and Jimmie Lunceford. Its offices were originally above Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe (whose walls are lined with photographs of jazz musicians who ate there), but moved to 409 Massachusetts Avenue around 1930. Local 535 and Local 9 (the white union) were ordered by the courts to merge into Boston Musicians Association Local 9-535 in 1970, and most of the Black musicians left.[25]\nEducation[edit]\nBoston University Medical Campus\nThe South End has five primary and secondary schools, providing education from kindergarten through grade 12 as part of Boston Public Schools. The McKinley South End Academy is four schools, a special-education school that focuses on behavioral, emotional and learning needs.[26] The Josiah Quincy Upper School teaches grades six to 12, balancing core-subject requirements with world languages, the arts and physical education.[27] Blackstone Elementary School has over 500 students from diverse backgrounds from pre-kindergarten to grade five.[28] Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology, established in 1908, is a four-year South End school for students desiring a technical degree.\nCommunity resources[edit]\nThe South End is served by three public libraries, and the South End Branch has a diverse collection of popular and scholarly materials for adults and children.[29] It has local-history documents, DVDs, CDs and audiobooks for adults, and recurring programs for children.[29] Programs for adults include monthly book-discussion groups and a weekly English conversation class.[29] The Blackstone Community Center, on West Brookline Street, is one of 35 community centers for youth and families and the only one serving the South End and lower Roxbury.[28] Blackstone's mission is to enhance the quality of life for Boston residents by \"supporting children, youth, and families through a wide range of programs and services\",[28] and it has a number of programs for children and adults.[28] Two major hospitals in the South End are Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine.[3] The South End Community Health Center, a board-governed non-profit \"comprehensive, health care organization for all residents of the South End and the surrounding communities\", is \"committed to providing the highest quality, culturally and linguistically sensitive, coordinated health care and social services to every patient, regardless of their ability to pay\".[30] Services include adult medicine, behavioral health, dental care and nutrition to name a few.[30]\nOther community organizations include South End Baseball, Youth Enrichment Services, the South End Lower Roxbury Open Space Land Trust, Mytown (an organization training youth to lead walking tours on neighborhood and Boston history), the South End Historical Society, Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion, and United South End Settlements. The Animal Rescue League of Boston, founded in 1899 by Anna Harris Smith, is at 10 Chandler Street. The league has an animal shelter, an animal-cruelty investigation and prosecution law-enforcement department, a rescue department, an animal-behavior department and Boston Veterinary Care, an outpatient veterinary facility.\nDiversity[edit]\nHoly Cross Cathedral\nThe South End's population has been diverse since the 1880s when Irish, Lebanese, Jewish, African-American, Puerto rican, Italian, and Greek people began to settle in the neighborhood. A number of immigrants from Canada's maritime provinces found economic opportunity in Boston, and homes in the South End, during the 1930s.\nIn the 1940s, particularly after the end of World War II, the South End's rooming houses became home to a growing number of gays and lesbians; single-sex rooming houses provided a home and social cover for LGBT people. Late in the decade, the Hispanic population began to grow; at first, much of this settlement was centered around the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. The neighborhood remains diverse, with people of nearly every race, religion, and sexual orientation.[31]\nIncome levels are anecdotally reported as stratified, with concentrations of wealth and poverty, but neither the U.S. census or the city of Boston reports the neighborhood's income. Although gentrification is sometimes cited as a reason for the flight of poorer, non-white residents, the neighborhood has maintained racial and income diversity due to its subsidized, publicly owned, or otherwise low-income housing units and a homeless shelter. Subsidized, below-market-rate housing developments such as Methunion Manor, Cathedral Housing (a public housing project), Villa Victoria, Tent City, Lenox Street Apartments, Camden, Camfield Gardens, 1850 Washington St, and Mandela Homes and represent evolving attitudes to public-housing design and governance.\nAlthough all neighborhoods in Boston experience crime, the city has a comparatively low incidence of street crime. Some parts of the South End are known for street crime, and others are family friendly. The neighborhood has more public playgrounds per square foot than other Boston neighborhoods. The South End is known as an increasingly upper middle class neighborhood, although it is still home to many lower income residents. Some long-time residents are being pushed out by rising rents and property taxes.\nThe South End has been known as a gay, artistic, and cultural neighborhood, although costs in the neighborhood are rising. Unlike cities such as New York and Los Angeles, there are no city policies to help artists keep their long-term studios. Existing art galleries, however, are flourishing. GardenMoms, one of Boston's most popular online parent groups with over 2,500 members citywide, was founded by several South End mothers in 2002.[32]\n2010 census[edit]\nSouth End townhouses\nAccording to the 2010 census, the South End's population was 24,577 (a 12.2-percent increase from 2000).[4] The neighborhood was 55.2 percent white, 13.3 percent Hispanic or Latino, 12.5 percent Black, 16.2 percent Asian, and 2.7 percent other groups.[4] As for age, 33.8 percent of the population was between 20 and 34 years old and eight percent were under age nine;[4] 5.9 percent of South End residents were 10\u201319 years old, 31.2 percent were 35-54, 10.5 percent were 55-64, and 10.6 percent were 65 or older.[4] The median age for the South End is 36.[4] About 55.2 percent of the population hold a college degree; 29.2 percent have a bachelor's degree, and 26 percent hold a graduate degree.[4] The primary language spoken in the neighborhood is English (65.6 percent), followed by Spanish (12.9 percent), Chinese (10.4 percent), French (2.7 percent), Portuguese (one percent), and other languages (7.4 percent).[4] The median annual South End income is $57,699, with 10.9 percent of the population earning $50,000 to $74,000.[4] There are 12,831 households in the South End, with 23.3 percent living in a family that includes a wife and a husband; 47.4 percent live alone.[4] In 2010, 45.2 percent of residents did not own a vehicle.[4] Thirty-four percent of residents use public transportation, excluding taxis.[4] The South End has 58.1 percent of its population working in the management, business, science, and arts sectors, with 79.1 percent of the labor force between the ages of 20 and 34.[4] According to the 2010 census, 72.6 percent of the South End has lived in the same place for the past year; 12.8 percent moved to a different location in the same county, 7.5 percent moved from a different county, and 5.9 percent moved from a different state to the South End.[4]\nPublic transportation[edit]\nPrudential station\nThe South End is near MBTA stops, including Copley, Symphony, and Prudential stations on the Green Line and Ruggles, Massachusetts Avenue, and Back Bay stations on the Orange Line.[33] Commuter rail service on the Franklin/Foxboro, Needham, and Providence/Stoughton lines is available at the Ruggles and Back Bay stations. Back Bay is also served by the Framingham/Worcester Line. These commuter rail lines continue to South Station.\nThe bus rapid transit Silver Line routes SL4 and SL5 between Nubian Square and downtown Boston run on Washington Street through the South End, with several stops between Lenox and Herald Streets. The neighborhood is also served by local MBTA bus routes. Major routes include route 43 on Tremont Street and route 1 on Massachusetts Avenue.\nGallery[edit]\n1950s[edit]\nBoston Herald Traveler Building, 1952\u20131956\nMotte Street with 1000 Washington in the background, June 24, 1952\nRear of houses on Harrision Avenue and Johnny Court, 1952\u20131958\nTot lot on Troy Street, 1952\u20131958\nShawmut Avenue at Tremont Street, December 4, 1956\nDon Bosco Technical High School, Warrenton Street, December 4, 1956\nNortheast from roof of 100 Arlington Street, December 4, 1956\nContemporary images[edit]\nColumbus Avenue and Dartmouth Street\nLawrence Street\nDartmouth Place\nSide street\nUnion Park Street\nWorcester Square\nUnion Park and Tremont Streets\nTremont Street\nClarendon Street, with the John Hancock Tower in the background\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"National Register Information System\".

There are certain areas to avoid in Boston, as they exhibit higher than normal crime rates. Routine activities like walking alone at night or leaving vehicles unattended can inadvertently trigger criminal acts, particularly in neighborhoods considered high-risk. Boston serves as an illustrative case of a city grappling with such concerns, primarily due to its expansive size and high population density. Drawing from recent crime data, we've compiled a list of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Boston for 2024. These rankings are predicated on the incidence of violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and assault) per 100,000 residents in each neighborhood, juxtaposed against the city's overall violent crime average. Our identification of the most worst neighborhoods in Boston is grounded in crime data furnished by the local law enforcement agency, supplemented by demographic data estimates where official statistics are unavailable.\nRecognizing the human toll behind each statistic is paramount. Violent crime affects individuals and families profoundly. These rankings of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Boston serve not only to identify areas requiring urgent attention but also to mobilize collective efforts for the safety and welfare of all Boston residents. Through collaboration among locals, Boston can aspire to create neighborhoods characterized by security, resilience and opportunity. Addressing urban safety demands a holistic approach, going beyond mere statistical analysis to tackle socio-economic disparities and enhance community-police partnerships.

Neighborhoods like Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester stand out for historically high crime rates, while areas such as South Boston are marked by gang-related crimes. Efforts to address these issues include housing policy initiatives targeting high-crime areas for improvements and the implementation of community policing in neighborhoods like Roxbury. Despite some positive trends, such as a decrease in overall violent crimes reported by the City of Boston, the statistics indicate ongoing challenges in combatting crime across different parts of the city.\nSources\ncity-data.com\nneighborhoodscout.com\nbostonglobe.com\nareavibes.com\nbostonherald.com\nwbur.org\ncdc.gov\ntrulia.com\nmass.gov\nboston.gov\nBrowse More Statistic Reports\nJapan Tourist Statistics\nPlastic Coating Industry Statistics\nAverage Room Dimensions Statistics\nMcdonalds Breakfast Serving Duration Statistics\nMedical Spa Industry Statistics\nBatman Martial Arts Proficiency Statistics\nMost Insurance Policies Exclude Losses By Statistics\nLaw Industry Statistics\nNaltrexone Efficacy Duration Statistics\nFruit Juice Industry Statistics\nMost Regular Season Wins Nhl Statistics\nGlobal Software Industry Statistics\nWorldMetrics.org\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

In this first article I want to look at the relationship between drug hotspots and robbery hotspots (those committed against individuals rather than commercial places). The second will look at property crime: theft/larceny against individuals, with the third looking at different types of auto-theft hotspots.\nBoston's Drug Hotspots\nWhen using incident reports to analyze crime hotspots, it\u2019s important to recognize that some incidents are reported and other discovered e.g., an auto theft is likely to be reported by the owner, whereas a drug deal, is likely to be \u201cdiscovered\u201d by law enforcement. This difference also effects the statistics; most car owners will report the theft of a car in order to generate an incident report for insurance reasons, whereas a drug dealer is actively avoiding being caught and an incident report being generated. This is one of the reasons we can trust the true number of automobile thefts, far more than we can trust the true number of drug deals etc. It\u2019s also why the numbers of auto theft are more likely to reflect the true nature of events than crimes such as robbery and petty theft, where those victimized, knowing that they\u2019re unlikely to see their assets (property, cash, goods etc.) returned, decide not to report the crime e.g., having $30, stolen from you, and having to cancel your credit cards may not seem a serious enough event to warrant it being reported to law enforcement. When we look at incident reports that relate to \u201cdiscovered\u201d crimes, one of the things that needs to be considered is the number of officers patrolling an area, along with population density. This also highlights one of the issues with stop and search policies e.g., if we make an assumption that 10% of a city\u2019s population uses illegal recreational drugs, and has possession of them at any particular time, and then look at a relatively small geographical area in the locale that houses 20% of the city\u2019s population, if you initiate a stop and search policy, and compare it to a neighborhood that has 10% of the city\u2019s population, then your stop and search policy is likely to be twice as \u201ceffective\u201d when compared. If you then double the number of officers in that area who engage in stop and search, you double the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d again. This is not to say that there isn\u2019t merit, at times, for stopping and searching individuals, however it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, where statistical success is seen as real success.\nBoston has two very distinct drug hotspots, one in the city center, and one in the South End. It has long been understood that certain types of institutions and organizations have a certain gravitational effect on crime i.e., they draw those with a tendency to offend towards them. One such institution is trauma hospitals i.e., those that have busy emergency rooms. At the center of the \u201cSouth End\u201d is Boston Medical Center. This hospital is the largest and busiest provider of emergency services, not just in Boston or Massachusetts but in the whole of New England. Whilst there are clusters of other hospitals in the Fenway/Kenmore area and towards the north of the city around Beacon Hill, these don\u2019t illicit the same type of pull, that those hospitals in the South End do. Those who use illegal drugs understand the risks they are taking and being close to an emergency room where they can quickly be treated increases their survival chances, it also means that there is a greater chance of medical staff being in the locale who may be carrying Narcan, an opioid overdose treatment. It has also been estimated that an emergency department which sees around 75 000 patient visits a year, can expect that around 262 of the monthly visits they receive will be from fabricating drug-seeking patients i.e., those making up/fabricating a reason in order to receive opioid/pain medication (Hansen, 2005); Boston Medical Center had 1,108,461 visits the previous year. Where there are addicts, there will be dealers.\nBoston's Robbery Hotspots\nBoston\u2019s drug hotspots are also its robbery hotspots \u2013 at the meso level i.e., this doesn\u2019t mean that it contains Boston\u2019s most prolific street segments and intersections, but rather that it contains the highest concentration, at a \u201cneighborhood\u201d level. The South End area, around the Boston Medical Center, is an area where statistically you are likely to be robbed at the same rate as its city center. Whilst the city center attracts significantly more people to it, BMC (Boston Medical Center) and its surrounding hospitals generate enough foot traffic, that it attracts both enough potential legitimate targets and motivated offenders, for it to create a hotspot. It is worth noting that some of those who commit robbery offenses may be visiting the hospital for legitimate reasons, and during the time they spend in and around the hospital, may find/spot offending opportunities. Such locations may also become areas of repeat victimization for those who work in these locations e.g., if you are a nurse, member of the maintenance team etc., you may regularly find yourself in the same location, at the same time, over, and over again. If there is a persistent offender who also finds that they share this space with you, because of their routine(s), the first time they victimize you may not be the last. Whilst too much emphasis is put on varying routes for safety etc., once you have been targeted it is worth attempting to avoid being in that location, at that time again. Once you have been victimized, changing routes and routines is worth doing; not so much as to appear \u201crandom\u201d but so as to avoid re-victimization.\nNext week\u2019s article will look at auto theft, how certain areas of Boston are hotspots for this type of offense, and how there are different hotspots for the theft of automobiles and motorbikes i.e., they are distinct and different. The article will also look at how theft and robbery differ by geography.\n\n\nCLICK TO GO BACK\n\nABOUT GERSHON BEN KEREN\nGershon Ben Keren is a 5th Degree Black Belt in Krav Maga, who received his teaching certifications in Israel.

However, like any city, it has its share of dangerous neighborhoods. Here are some of the worst areas in Boston, based on crime rates:\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods In Boston\n1. Central\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nCentral, an area in Boston, poses significant risks to its residents. With a crime rate of 5,452 incidents per 100,000 people, which is a stagg\u00adering 321% higher than the national average, it has gained notoriety as the most dangerous neighborhood in the city. Although property crimes are prevalent in Central, violent offenses also contr\u00adibute to their worrisome reput\u00adation.\n2. Roxbury\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nRoxbury is another one of Boston\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods. It has a total crime rate of 4,727 per 100,000 residents, 273% higher than the national average. Like Central, most of the crime in Roxbury is property crime, but violent crime is also a problem.\n3. Dorchester\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nDorch\u00adester, a large neighborhood in Boston, houses a population of over 130,000 residents. While the northern region of Dorch\u00adester remains relat\u00adively safe, the southern part stands out as one of the city\u2019s most dangerous areas. In fact, South Dorch\u00adester exhibits a stagg\u00adering total crime rate of 3,295 per 100,000 resid\u00adents\u2014a discon\u00adcerting statistic that exceeds the Massac\u00adhusetts state average by 142%.\n4. Mattapan\nMattapan, a small neighborhood in Boston, has an appro\u00adximate population of 30,000 people. It is recognized for its high crime rate, surpa\u00adssing the state average by 138% and exceeding Boston\u2019s average by 27%. Mattapan faces prevalent property crimes, including theft, car break-ins, and larce\u00adny.\n5. South End\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nThe South End, a trendy district in Boston, is home to numerous eateries and stores. While it offers various dining options and shopping experiences, it also harbors one of the city\u2019s most dangerous neighbo\u00adrhoods. With a total crime rate of 2,996 per 100,000 residents \u2013 exceeding the state average by 129% \u2013 certain sections of the South End are infamous for street-related crimes while others provide a safe haven suitable for families.\n6. North Dorchester\nDorch\u00adester, a city with around 130,000 resid\u00adents, is where almost one-fifth of all Bosto\u00adnians call home. Its total crime rate stands at 2,823 per 100,000 residents, which exceeds the state average by 121%.\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nBased on crime maps provided by the Dorch\u00adester Reporter, the more dangerous areas within Dorch\u00adester are situated west of Columbia Road. Criminal activity tends to be concen\u00adtrated around the vicinity of Blue Hill Avenue.\n7. Hyde Park\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nHyde Park, a neighborhood located in Boston\u2019s South End, has a total crime rate of 2,888 per 100,000 residents. This rate exceeds the state average by 124%. Despite this higher rate, Hyde Park is generally considered relat\u00adively safe with regard to violent crime. Most incidents in the area are property-related offenses like thefts and burgl\u00adaries, although assaults can occur.\n8. Jamaica Plain\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nJamaica Plain is generally considered to be a safe neighborhood in Boston. However, like any city, it has its share of crime. According to the Boston Police Department, the crime rate in Jamaica Plain is 1,852 per 100,000 residents, which is 21% lower than the national average. The majority of crime in Jamaica Plain is property crime, such as burglaries and thefts. Violent crime is also a problem but is less common than property crime.\n9. Back Bay-Beacon Hill\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nBack Bay-Beacon Hill is one of the bad areas of Boston. The crime rate here is 4,041 crimes per 100,000 residents, almost 140% higher than the state average. Living in Back Bay-Beacon Hill means you have a 1 in 25 chance of becoming a victim of crime.\n10. South Dorchester\nSouth Dorchester stands tall among the worst parts of Boston. According to Areavibes, the crime rate here is 40% higher than the national average, with the violent crime rate standing at 119% and the property crime rate 24% higher than the U.S. average.\n11. East Boston\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nEast Boston wraps up our list of bad areas of Boston. In terms of overall crime rate and property crime rate, the neighborhood is considered safe; however, the violent crime rate, standing at 8% higher than the national average, is a concern for the residents.\nIs South Boston Safe?\nSouth Boston is widely regarded as a secure neighborhood within the city. However, like any urban area, it does experience some criminal activity. The crime rate in South Boston stands at 1,728 incidents per 100,000 residents, which is approximately 15% lower than the national average.\nWhen considering safety levels within South Boston itself, the western and central parts of the neighborhood are considered to be the most secure areas. On the other hand, the southern and eastern sections of the neighborhood tend to have higher rates of crime.\nWorst Parts of Boston: Takeaway\nIt is important to note that these are just a few of the many dangerous neighborhoods in Boston. The crime rates in these neighborhoods can vary, so it is always best to do your research before moving to or visiting any neighborhood in Boston and consider consulting with a reputable moving company to ensure a secure and smooth transition.\nTrending\n10 Most Landlord Friendly States 2024\n10 Most Tenant Friendly States 2024\nNYC Local Law 11 \u2013 Complete Guide\nLetter Of No Objection In NYC Real Estate\n9 Common Basement Types: Which One Should You Choose?\nGeneral\nUnderstanding the Role of a Mortgage Broker in the Homebuying Process\nGeneral\nLien Theory vs Title Theory States: Understanding the Difference\nGeneral\nJudicial vs Non Judicial Foreclosure: What\u2019s The Difference?\nApartment\nWhat is an SRO NYC? \u2013 Ultimate Guide\nprev\nnext\nTOP APARTMENTS OF THE WEEK\nStudio apartment search in ny\none bedroom apartment\ntwo bedrooms apartments in nyc\nView More\nRENTALS\nNo Fee Rentals\nRenters Guide\nList Your Rental\nRoomate Search\n\n\nSALES\nBuyer Guide\nSeller Guide\nAvailability\nWant to sell your property?\nNYRENTOWNSELL\nAgents\nAbout Us\nCareers\nOffice Location\n\n\nDISCOVER\nMedia Housing\nRelocation\nFlexing\nBlog\nMOBILE APPS\n\u00a9 2019 Ny rent own sell 25 broadway 9 th floor, New York, NY 10038\n1-917-436-9219 | info@nyrentownsell.com\nDisclaimer\nSubscribe\nHomes for Sale\nHomes for Rent", "0:00 / 1:50", "Livability\nSearchMassachusettsBostonCrime\nBoston, MA Crime Rates\nOverview\nLivability\nDemographics\nBest Places Nearby\nNeighborhoods\nLivability\n77\nAmenities\nA+\nCommute\nA+\nCost of Living\nF\nCrime\nF\nEmployment\nA+\nHousing\nB-\nHealth & Safe\nA+\nSchools\nD\nUser Ratings\nB-\nF\n4%\nTotal crime\nNAT.

There are two main categories of crime - violent crime and property crime. Violent crime consists of murder, rape, robbery and assault, while property crimes include burglary, theft and vehicle theft. There were a total of 3955 violent crimes in Boston (619 per 100,000 people), which is 67.4% higher than the national average and there were a total of 11514 property crimes (1802 per 100,000 residents) which is 7.8% lower than average.\nIn terms of the total Boston crime rate per 100,000 people, it falls within the midrange when compared to other cities across the United States. Our analysis of total crimes, encompassing both violent and property offenses in Boston, revealed that the reported crime rates closely align with the nationwide average reported by other areas.\nThe property crime rate per 100,000 people in Boston is very similar to the national average. Boston had a property crime rate of 1802, while the national average was 1954. Based on these numbers, you could expect an average amount of property crime in this area.\nWhat Do the Locals Say About Crime in Boston?\nAreaVibes has conducted polls asking local residents if they feel safe living in Boston. Based on the results of the surveys (233 responses), 57% of people felt that there was very little crime in Boston and felt safe walking alone at night. While 43% of people felt that it was not a safe place to live and did not feel safe walking alone at night.\nIs Boston a Safe Place to Live?\nDetermining whether Boston is a place to live may not always yield a simple answer, given the city's varying safety levels across different areas. Nonetheless, comprehending the city's overall crime rate can be a valuable asset. In broad terms, Boston has an overall crime rate that is 4% higher than the national average. When we take a look at crime on a daily basis, this translates into 42.38 daily occurrences, comprising 10.84 violent crimes and 31.55 property crimes. Scrutinizing these statistics provides a foundation for a more informed assessment of the suitability of Boston as a potential place to establish residency.\nHas Crime in Boston Increased Since Last Year?\nIn the most recent crime report, year-over-year crime rates in Boston has decreased by 0.2%. Examining the change in crime rates from one year to the next provides valuable insights into the evolving safety landscape of Boston, aiding residents in assessing whether it is becoming a safer or more dangerous place to live. These crime rates are categorized into two primary groups: violent and property crimes. Year-over-year, violent crime has increased by 1.8%, while property crime has decreased by 0.9%. This comprehensive analysis offers potential residents essential information for making informed decisions about whether or not Boston is a safe place to live.\nBoston Neighborhood Crime Rates\nThere are more than 16 different neighborhoods in the Boston area. Depending on their location and other socioeconomic factors, the rate of crime in each neighborhood is vastly different. Areas that are located near the center or downtown core, tend to be more densely populated and typically see higher crime rates. While neighborhoods in the outskirts of the city tend to be less densely populated and have lower unemployment and poverty rates. Some of the safer neighborhoods in Boston include West Roxbury, Allston-Brighton and Roslindale. While Central, Roxbury and South End have a reported crime rate that is higher than average. This reinforces the need to do a quality check on multiple neighborhoods as their crime rates can be quite different.\nPotential Causes for Crime in Boston\nIn Boston, the poverty rate currently stands at 18%, which contrasts with the national average of 15.1%. It's essential to recognize that the economic status of a city's inhabitants could be a pivotal factor influencing crime stats. Communities grappling with high poverty rates and income inequality are often susceptible to elevated crime levels, as some individuals may turn to unlawful activities to fulfill their essential needs. While lower poverty rates could lead to a reduction in Boston crime rates.\nHighly populated regions typically encompass expansive urban hubs teeming with diverse economic prospects. Within these areas, income inequality can be exacerbated, giving rise to enclaves of poverty amid affluence. Communities marked by economic disparities may contend with heightened property crimes, and in certain instances, violent crimes. Conversely, regions characterized by low population density often exhibit lower Boston crime rates. For instance, in Boston, the population density stands at 14259.9 people per square mile, diverging from the national average of 90.6 people per square mile.\nThe level of education within a community can impact crime rates. Higher educational attainment often correlates with lower crime rates, as it provides individuals with better job opportunities and alternatives to criminal behavior. While lower educational achievement rates tend to lead to higher crime rates. In Boston, 82.8% of people have completed high school, while 83% of people have completed high school nationally.\nBoston Crime Map\n\u00a9 Proximitii\n\u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors\n\u00a9 OpenMapTiles\nLeaflet\n+\n\u2212\n\n\nThe Boston crime map provides a detailed overview of all crimes in Boston as reported by the local law enforcement agencies. Based on the color coded legend above, the crime map outlines the areas with lower crime compared to the areas with higher crime. The Boston crime heat map offers insight into the total crimes on a block group level.

When determining if the city is right for you, one of your many concerns may be safety. Is Boston a safe city? Actually, Boston is one of the safest big cities in America! The Boston crime rate is below the national average and far below similarly sized metro areas. It has almost half the crime as Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Chicago!\nTo help you decide if Boston is right for you, here\u2019s a comprehensive guide to crime in Boston including dangerous areas to avoid and the safest neighborhoods.\nTable of Contents\nUnderstanding the Boston Crime Rate\nViolent Crime in Boston\nProperty Crime in Boston\nHigh Crime Areas of Boston\nSafest Neighborhoods in Boston\nBoston Safety Tips \u2013 How to Avoid Crime in Boston\nBoston Police Department\nBoston Crime Rate FAQ\nIs Boston a safe place to live?\nIs Downtown Boston safe?\nIs Boston safer than New York?\nUnderstanding the Boston Crime Rate\nThe most common and effective way to compare the safety of different cities is by comparing crime rates. A city\u2019s crime rate is reported as the number of crimes for every 100,000 residents. This methodology allows you to compare cities of different sizes, understand your risk of being the victim of crime, and assess the scale of different types of crime in the city.\nThe Boston crime rate below is based on the 2019 FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. The FBI determines crime rates by dividing the number of police-reported crimes in a city and dividing it by the population. This number is multiplied by 100,000 to calculate the crime rate.\nYou will usually see three crime rates for a city: an overall crime rate, a property crime rate, and a violent crime rate. Violent crimes include assault, homicide, robbery, and sexual assault. Property crime includes vandalism, arson, car theft, and shoplifting. Not all crimes are included in crime rates. For example, drug crimes are not included because they do not reflect your risk of being the victim of crime.\nAs you assess Boston crime, it\u2019s helpful to compare it to the national crime rate:\n2,580 crimes per 100,000 people\n2,362 property crimes per 100,000 people\n383 violent crimes per 100,000 people\nYou can also compare the Boston crime rate to the Massachusetts average. Keep in mind crime rates are usually higher in metro areas like Boston compared to suburbs and rural areas. The Massachusetts crime rate is 1,507 crimes per 100k people. There is a 1 in 66 chance of being a victim of crime. The Massachusetts violent crime rate is 327.6/100k people. The property crime rate in Massachusetts is 1,180 per 100k people.\nWhat is the crime rate in Boston?\nThe total crime rate in Boston is 2,639 crimes per 100,000 people.\nYou have a 1 in 38 chance of being the victim of crime in Boston.\nIn 2018, there were 18,331 crimes reported in the city of 695,000.\nViolent Crime in Boston\nYou have a 1 in 161 chance of being the victim of violent crime in Boston. The Boston violent crime rate is 622 violent crimes per 100,000 people. The Boston murder rate is 8.1 murders per 100k people.\nThe 4,324 crimes reported in one year in Boston fell into the following categories:\n2,818 aggravated assaults\n1,172 robberies\n278 rapes\n56 murders and non-negligent manslaughter\nViolent crime declined in Boston from 2018 to 2019. There were 38 homicides in 2019, down from 56 in 2018. 29 of these homicides were shootings. The number of rapes and attempted sexual assaults also declined. Robberies and attempted robberies decreased to 1,038 in 2019.\nSome forms of violent crime increased in 2019 including aggravated domestic assault, assault, and non-fatal shootings.\nProperty Crime in Boston\nYou have a 1 in 50 chance of being the victim of property crime in Boston. The Boston property crime rate is 2,016 property crimes per 100,000 people.\nIn a single year, there were 14,007 property crimes reported including:\n11,000 thefts and larceny\n1,853 burglaries\n1,154 motor vehicle thefts\n0 arsons\nWhen it comes to burglary, Boston is the second-safest large city in the United States according to Protect America, a home security company.\nHigh Crime Areas of Boston\nBoston is a safe city, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s without crime and high-risk areas. As with most cities, crime tends to be hyper-localized to specific neighborhoods. The best way to stay safe in Boston is to avoid moving to one of the more dangerous areas of Boston or visiting at night.\nDowntown Boston in 2019 had two high-profile abductions of women that occurred outside nightclubs, one of which ended in death. The downtown area also has a higher rate of reported rapes and attempted rapes which increased in 2019 over 2018 despite rapes decreasing overall in the city.\nCentral/Downtown Boston is where much of the Boston crime occurs. Downtown has 158% more crime than Boston overall and a violent crime rate of 1,600 crimes per 100k people.\nRoxbury has 104% more crime than Boston overall with a high violent crime rate of 1,271/100k people. Roxbury has a higher rate of rape and attempted rape and it\u2019s most known for drugs and violent crime.\nDorchester with up to 36% more crime than the Boston average depending on whether you\u2019re in South or North Dorchester. Some parts of Dorchester are quite safe as this is a very large neighborhood with almost 88,000 residents. However, you\u2019ll want to be careful going into many areas of Dorchester known for violent crime.\nMattapan is one of the more affordable neighborhoods in Boston but has a fairly high crime rate. It has a reputation for crime, especially violent crime, firearms, and drugs.\nSome areas of Boston that once had a reputation for crime and poverty have been completely transformed by revitalization and rising home prices. The best example is South Boston which was a poor and dangerous area but is now a safe and close-knit community with high housing prices.\nSafest Neighborhoods in Boston\nRemember that crime in Boston is very localized. Even in neighborhoods considered dangerous, you\u2019ll find safe places to live \u2013 especially in very large communities like Dorchester. Here are some of the safest places to live in Boston and the most desirable with amenities you\u2019ll appreciate.\nJamaica Plain, a diverse community with crime rates 25% below the national average\nHyde Park in South Boston which is safer than 60% of Massachusetts cities.\nMIT, known for its young professionals and students, has a crime rate 71% below the national average.\nWest Roxbury which has a suburban feel with 68% less crime than the Boston average. Don\u2019t be fooled by the bad reputation of Roxbury as a whole: this quiet area is great for families and more affordable than many areas of Boston.\n  View this post on Instagram\n  A post shared by Maria Mongiardo (@maria.mongiardo)\nTo help you find safe places to live in Boston, try using this Boston crime map.

The crime rate is lower than the national average.\nIs Downtown Boston safe?\nWhile downtown is largely considered safe, crime does occur, especially property crime and violent crime near bars and nightclubs at night.\nIs Boston safer than New York?\nBoston is the second-safest large city in the U.S. after El Paso, TX.

[Data, Stats, Reports, Map]\n0\nSHARES\nLast Updated on: 20th June 2022, 10:40 pm\nThinking about moving to Boston, Massachusetts? When determining if the city is right for you, one of your many concerns may be safety. Is Boston a safe city? Actually, Boston is one of the safest big cities in America! The Boston crime rate is below the national average and far below similarly sized metro areas. It has almost half the crime as Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Chicago!\nTo help you decide if Boston is right for you, here\u2019s a comprehensive guide to crime in Boston including dangerous areas to avoid and the safest neighborhoods.\nTable of Contents\nUnderstanding the Boston Crime Rate\nViolent Crime in Boston\nProperty Crime in Boston\nHigh Crime Areas of Boston\nSafest Neighborhoods in Boston\nBoston Safety Tips \u2013 How to Avoid Crime in Boston\nBoston Police Department\nBoston Crime Rate FAQ\nIs Boston a safe place to live?\nIs Downtown Boston safe?\nIs Boston safer than New York?\nUnderstanding the Boston Crime Rate\nThe most common and effective way to compare the safety of different cities is by comparing crime rates. A city\u2019s crime rate is reported as the number of crimes for every 100,000 residents. This methodology allows you to compare cities of different sizes, understand your risk of being the victim of crime, and assess the scale of different types of crime in the city.\nThe Boston crime rate below is based on the 2019 FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. The FBI determines crime rates by dividing the number of police-reported crimes in a city and dividing it by the population. This number is multiplied by 100,000 to calculate the crime rate.\nYou will usually see three crime rates for a city: an overall crime rate, a property crime rate, and a violent crime rate. Violent crimes include assault, homicide, robbery, and sexual assault. Property crime includes vandalism, arson, car theft, and shoplifting. Not all crimes are included in crime rates. For example, drug crimes are not included because they do not reflect your risk of being the victim of crime.\nAs you assess Boston crime, it\u2019s helpful to compare it to the national crime rate:\n2,580 crimes per 100,000 people\n2,362 property crimes per 100,000 people\n383 violent crimes per 100,000 people\nYou can also compare the Boston crime rate to the Massachusetts average. Keep in mind crime rates are usually higher in metro areas like Boston compared to suburbs and rural areas. The Massachusetts crime rate is 1,507 crimes per 100k people. There is a 1 in 66 chance of being a victim of crime. The Massachusetts violent crime rate is 327.6/100k people. The property crime rate in Massachusetts is 1,180 per 100k people.\nWhat is the crime rate in Boston?\nThe total crime rate in Boston is 2,639 crimes per 100,000 people.\nYou have a 1 in 38 chance of being the victim of crime in Boston.\nIn 2018, there were 18,331 crimes reported in the city of 695,000.\nViolent Crime in Boston\nYou have a 1 in 161 chance of being the victim of violent crime in Boston. The Boston violent crime rate is 622 violent crimes per 100,000 people. The Boston murder rate is 8.1 murders per 100k people.\nThe 4,324 crimes reported in one year in Boston fell into the following categories:\n2,818 aggravated assaults\n1,172 robberies\n278 rapes\n56 murders and non-negligent manslaughter\nViolent crime declined in Boston from 2018 to 2019. There were 38 homicides in 2019, down from 56 in 2018. 29 of these homicides were shootings. The number of rapes and attempted sexual assaults also declined. Robberies and attempted robberies decreased to 1,038 in 2019.\nSome forms of violent crime increased in 2019 including aggravated domestic assault, assault, and non-fatal shootings.\nProperty Crime in Boston\nYou have a 1 in 50 chance of being the victim of property crime in Boston. The Boston property crime rate is 2,016 property crimes per 100,000 people.\nIn a single year, there were 14,007 property crimes reported including:\n11,000 thefts and larceny\n1,853 burglaries\n1,154 motor vehicle thefts\n0 arsons\nWhen it comes to burglary, Boston is the second-safest large city in the United States according to Protect America, a home security company.\nHigh Crime Areas of Boston\nBoston is a safe city, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s without crime and high-risk areas. As with most cities, crime tends to be hyper-localized to specific neighborhoods. The best way to stay safe in Boston is to avoid moving to one of the more dangerous areas of Boston or visiting at night.\nDowntown Boston in 2019 had two high-profile abductions of women that occurred outside nightclubs, one of which ended in death. The downtown area also has a higher rate of reported rapes and attempted rapes which increased in 2019 over 2018 despite rapes decreasing overall in the city.\nCentral/Downtown Boston is where much of the Boston crime occurs. Downtown has 158% more crime than Boston overall and a violent crime rate of 1,600 crimes per 100k people.\nRoxbury has 104% more crime than Boston overall with a high violent crime rate of 1,271/100k people. Roxbury has a higher rate of rape and attempted rape and it\u2019s most known for drugs and violent crime.\nDorchester with up to 36% more crime than the Boston average depending on whether you\u2019re in South or North Dorchester. Some parts of Dorchester are quite safe as this is a very large neighborhood with almost 88,000 residents. However, you\u2019ll want to be careful going into many areas of Dorchester known for violent crime.\nMattapan is one of the more affordable neighborhoods in Boston but has a fairly high crime rate. It has a reputation for crime, especially violent crime, firearms, and drugs.\nSome areas of Boston that once had a reputation for crime and poverty have been completely transformed by revitalization and rising home prices. The best example is South Boston which was a poor and dangerous area but is now a safe and close-knit community with high housing prices.\nSafest Neighborhoods in Boston\nRemember that crime in Boston is very localized. Even in neighborhoods considered dangerous, you\u2019ll find safe places to live \u2013 especially in very large communities like Dorchester. Here are some of the safest places to live in Boston and the most desirable with amenities you\u2019ll appreciate.\nJamaica Plain, a diverse community with crime rates 25% below the national average\nHyde Park in South Boston which is safer than 60% of Massachusetts cities.\nMIT, known for its young professionals and students, has a crime rate 71% below the national average.\nWest Roxbury which has a suburban feel with 68% less crime than the Boston average. Don\u2019t be fooled by the bad reputation of Roxbury as a whole: this quiet area is great for families and more affordable than many areas of Boston.\n  View this post on Instagram\n  A post shared by Maria Mongiardo (@maria.mongiardo)\nTo help you find safe places to live in Boston, try using this Boston crime map. Universal Hub is also a great source for news on crime in Boston. This community news hub combines local news from a variety of sources, including local social media posts.\nBoston Safety Tips \u2013 How to Avoid Crime in Boston\nAreas popular with tourists during the day in Boston are more dangerous at night. This includes the Common and downtown areas with nightclubs. Be aware of your surroundings and avoid cutting through the Common alone at night.\nBe wary in high-crime areas of Dorchester, Roxbury, and Mattapan.\nBe sure to lock your doors and windows to avoid being the victim of burglary, one of the most common types of property crime in Massachusetts.\nCrime on campuses in Boston is a fairly common problem, particularly theft of packages, cell phones, and laptops. Simple assault and sexual assault may also occur on campus. Be aware of your surroundings and consider a campus escort service. Boston University offers Scarlet SafeWalk nightly.\nBoston Police Department\nBoston Police Commissioner: William G. Gross\nSworn officers: 2,143 (779 civilian personnel)\nNon-emergency number: (617) 343-4500\nAddress: Boston Police Headquarters, 1 Schroeder Plaza, Boston, MA 02120\nThe Boston Police Department (BPD) is America\u2019s oldest police department and dates to 1838. It\u2019s the largest police force in New England and the 20th largest in the United States. Like many departments in the U.S. that have adopted community-oriented policing, BPD requires all officers to live within the Boston city limits. There are 11 neighborhood districts and three zones, each district with a Captain and each zone with a Deputy Superintendent.\nDistrict B-3 includes Mattapan and North Dorchester with over 36,000 residents and District C-11 serves Dorchester with 92,000 residents. Roxbury is in District B-2 with 77,000 residents. These three districts account for most serious crime in Boston.\nThe Boston Police Department has several divisions including a Forensic Technology Division, Family Justice Division, Police Rescue/Recovery Dive Team, Boston Police Harbor Unit, and the Boston Police Special Operations Unit.\nBoston Crime Rate FAQ\nIs Boston a safe place to live?\nAbsolutely, Boston is considered a very safe city, especially for a large city. The crime rate is lower than the national average.\nIs Downtown Boston safe?\nWhile downtown is largely considered safe, crime does occur, especially property crime and violent crime near bars and nightclubs at night.\nIs Boston safer than New York?\nBoston is the second-safest large city in the U.S. after El Paso, TX. New York is considered a metropolis, not a city, but it has a crime rate comparable to Boston.\nDespite a few dangerous areas of Boston where crime tends to be very localized, Boston is a very safe city and an amazing place to live. In most neighborhoods, you won\u2019t need to worry about crime with basic precautions. If you\u2019re ready to relocate to Boston and you\u2019ve found a safe neighborhood to make your home, call the friendly movers at Mass Bay Movers.

Despite some positive trends, such as a decrease in overall violent crimes reported by the City of Boston, the statistics indicate ongoing challenges in combatting crime across different parts of the city.\nSources\ncity-data.com\nneighborhoodscout.com\nbostonglobe.com\nareavibes.com\nbostonherald.com\nwbur.org\ncdc.gov\ntrulia.com\nmass.gov\nboston.gov\nBrowse More Statistic Reports\nJapan Tourist Statistics\nPlastic Coating Industry Statistics\nAverage Room Dimensions Statistics\nMcdonalds Breakfast Serving Duration Statistics\nMedical Spa Industry Statistics\nBatman Martial Arts Proficiency Statistics\nMost Insurance Policies Exclude Losses By Statistics\nLaw Industry Statistics\nNaltrexone Efficacy Duration Statistics\nFruit Juice Industry Statistics\nMost Regular Season Wins Nhl Statistics\nGlobal Software Industry Statistics\nWorldMetrics.org\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

Colonial Boston played a key role in the founding of the United States, and the city currently plays a major role in the culture and economy of the New England region. With many reasons to live in Boston, the safety question is a common concern. To make the most of visiting or relocating, we\u2019ve compiled a list of the twelve most dangerous places to live in Boston.\n12 Most Dangerous Neighborhoods in Boston\nCentral \nRoxbury\nSouth End\nNorth Dorchester \nSouth Dorchester\nMattapan\nBack Bay-Beacon Hill\nChelsea\nChinatown\nSouth Boston\nHyde Park\nJamaica Plain\n1. Central\nThe most dangerous neighborhood in Boston is Central. Although this area is in the heart of the city and has a population of around 33,000 residents, it is considered the worst part of Boston. Central\u2019s violent crime rate is exorbitantly high, being 321% higher than the national average. Despite its high crime rate, Central has multiple tourist attractions, including museums, arenas, and plenty of historical sites. Being located in Boston proper, Central benefits from being a convenient location. \n2. Roxbury \nRoxbury is another one of the most dangerous Boston neighborhoods. This area of Boston is known for having a high rate of violent crimes, gang activity, and property crime. With a population of 63,672, Roxbury has a crime rate that is 237% higher than the Massachusetts average. In addition, much of this neighborhood has fallen victim to disrepair and urban decay, with some parts of the neighborhood being revitalized. \n3. South End\nSouth End is another one of the worst areas in Boston for crime. South End has a population of 34,304 and a crime rate that is 169% higher than the state average. South End doesn\u2019t have a high violent crime rate, but property crime occurs often. Residents are advised to not keep personal belongings in their cars as they are often broken into. Despite having a high crime rate, the average home price in South End is still $568,400. \n4. North Dorchester \nNorth Dorchester has a population of 27,791 and a crime rate that is 156% higher than the national average. North Dorchester is a relatively low-income area with poorly rated schools and below-average employment options. Violent crime remains somewhat of a problem, with property crimes such as theft and vehicle theft being the most common. \n5. South Dorchester\nSouth Dorchester is a dangerous Boston neighborhood with a total crime rate of 3,295 per 100,000, which is 142% higher than the Massachusetts state average. While violent crime does occur in this neighborhood, most of the crime is related to property crime. However, violent crime is still prevalent, with assaults and robberies happening sporadically. It is advised to stay aware of your surroundings and use common sense if you are passing through South Dorchester. \n6. Mattapan\nMattapan has a population of 39,010 and a crime rate that is 141% higher than the state average, making it one of the worst neighborhoods in Boston for crime. Mattapan has a high property crime rate, with theft, car break-ins, and larceny being common. Despite this, Mattapan is considered to be an up-and-coming neighborhood that is undergoing revitalization. Much of Mattapan\u2019s housing remains public housing and small residential buildings. \n7. Back Bay-Beacon Hill\nBack Bay is a historic waterfront neighborhood known for its rows of Victorian brownstone houses. While crime may not be the largest concern for residents, Back Bay still has a crime rate that is 141% higher than the Massachusetts state average. However, most of this is property crimes such as car break-ins, vehicle theft, and other petty crimes. Back Bay is a relatively affluent community with a median income of $61,578 and a median home price of $352,652.\n8. Chelsea\nChelsea is another dangerous area in Boston. Situated directly across the Mystic River from Boston, Chelsea is a city that\u2019s home to about 40,000 residents. It\u2019s the second most densely populated city in Massachusetts after Somerville. Chelsea is famous for its historic buildings and authentic restaurants. However, it\u2019s also one of the more dangerous parts of the Boston area. The violent crime rate in Chelsea is 117% higher than the national average and 17% higher than the rest of Boston. It\u2019s more dangerous than 90% of US cities, and your odds of being the victim of a crime in Chelsea are 1 in 39. \n9. Chinatown\nChinatown is another dangerous Boston neighborhood. Considered a part of downtown Boston, Chinatown is a lively neighborhood known for its delicious dumpling houses and nightlife venues. It\u2019s one of Boston\u2019s most densely populated neighborhoods and it\u2019s one of the largest Chinatowns in the US, outside of New York City. Although not the most dangerous city in Boston, Chinatown does feature a violent crime rate that is significantly higher than the national average. The violent crime rate in Boston\u2019s Chinatown is 691 crimes per 100,000 residents, which is 39% higher than the rest of the country.\n10. South Boston\nSouth Boston is also one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Boston. South Boston is a relatively affluent area with access to ports, downtown, and entertainment options. Residents are advised to watch out for car theft and petty crime, and usually, this can be avoided if proper caution is used. Much of the existing criminal element in this neighborhood is being driven out by rising rent and home prices. \n11. Hyde Park\nHyde Park is a dangerous Boston neighborhood that is situated just 7.9 miles south of Downtown. Although Hyde Park has a violent crime rate that is 20% higher than the national average, it is considered relatively safe when it comes to violent crime. Most of the crimes in Hyde Park are property crimes, with the most common types of crime being theft and burglaries. However, assaults are not uncommon, so you should always be aware of your surroundings in the neighborhood. Hyde Park still attracts many visitors and residents, with a median home price of $324,484. \n12. Jamaica Plain\nJamaica Plain is another dangerous Boston neighborhood. It has a population of 45,158 and a crime rate that is 36% higher than the Massachusetts average. Jamaica Plain has been revitalized in recent years, with many older homes being rebuilt. The violent crime rate in this neighborhood is mostly assaults, with thefts and burglaries occurring sporadically. \nJoin our mailing list\nJoin\nFeatured Posts\nBiden's $25,000 Down Payment Toward Equity Act Guide\nMost Dangerous Cities in America\nCheapest Places to Live in Florida\nNYC Income Tax Guide\nStates With No Property Taxes on Homes\n15 Most Dangerous States in the US\nMore from the blog\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in Seattle\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in New Orleans\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in Los Angeles\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods in Baltimore\nCelebrities That Live In Naples, Florida\nUpper East Side vs Upper West Side\nCelebrities Who Live in Palm Beach Florida\nBuying a Used Lawnmower Guide\n\u00a9 PropertyClub 2024Terms|Privacy|Contact Us: contact@propertyclub.nyc", "Sign In\nWhat is the most dangerous part of Boston/Cambridge/MA generally speaking?

In this first article I want to look at the relationship between drug hotspots and robbery hotspots (those committed against individuals rather than commercial places). The second will look at property crime: theft/larceny against individuals, with the third looking at different types of auto-theft hotspots.\nBoston's Drug Hotspots\nWhen using incident reports to analyze crime hotspots, it\u2019s important to recognize that some incidents are reported and other discovered e.g., an auto theft is likely to be reported by the owner, whereas a drug deal, is likely to be \u201cdiscovered\u201d by law enforcement. This difference also effects the statistics; most car owners will report the theft of a car in order to generate an incident report for insurance reasons, whereas a drug dealer is actively avoiding being caught and an incident report being generated. This is one of the reasons we can trust the true number of automobile thefts, far more than we can trust the true number of drug deals etc. It\u2019s also why the numbers of auto theft are more likely to reflect the true nature of events than crimes such as robbery and petty theft, where those victimized, knowing that they\u2019re unlikely to see their assets (property, cash, goods etc.) returned, decide not to report the crime e.g., having $30, stolen from you, and having to cancel your credit cards may not seem a serious enough event to warrant it being reported to law enforcement. When we look at incident reports that relate to \u201cdiscovered\u201d crimes, one of the things that needs to be considered is the number of officers patrolling an area, along with population density. This also highlights one of the issues with stop and search policies e.g., if we make an assumption that 10% of a city\u2019s population uses illegal recreational drugs, and has possession of them at any particular time, and then look at a relatively small geographical area in the locale that houses 20% of the city\u2019s population, if you initiate a stop and search policy, and compare it to a neighborhood that has 10% of the city\u2019s population, then your stop and search policy is likely to be twice as \u201ceffective\u201d when compared. If you then double the number of officers in that area who engage in stop and search, you double the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d again. This is not to say that there isn\u2019t merit, at times, for stopping and searching individuals, however it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, where statistical success is seen as real success.\nBoston has two very distinct drug hotspots, one in the city center, and one in the South End. It has long been understood that certain types of institutions and organizations have a certain gravitational effect on crime i.e., they draw those with a tendency to offend towards them. One such institution is trauma hospitals i.e., those that have busy emergency rooms. At the center of the \u201cSouth End\u201d is Boston Medical Center. This hospital is the largest and busiest provider of emergency services, not just in Boston or Massachusetts but in the whole of New England. Whilst there are clusters of other hospitals in the Fenway/Kenmore area and towards the north of the city around Beacon Hill, these don\u2019t illicit the same type of pull, that those hospitals in the South End do. Those who use illegal drugs understand the risks they are taking and being close to an emergency room where they can quickly be treated increases their survival chances, it also means that there is a greater chance of medical staff being in the locale who may be carrying Narcan, an opioid overdose treatment. It has also been estimated that an emergency department which sees around 75 000 patient visits a year, can expect that around 262 of the monthly visits they receive will be from fabricating drug-seeking patients i.e., those making up/fabricating a reason in order to receive opioid/pain medication (Hansen, 2005); Boston Medical Center had 1,108,461 visits the previous year. Where there are addicts, there will be dealers.\nBoston's Robbery Hotspots\nBoston\u2019s drug hotspots are also its robbery hotspots \u2013 at the meso level i.e., this doesn\u2019t mean that it contains Boston\u2019s most prolific street segments and intersections, but rather that it contains the highest concentration, at a \u201cneighborhood\u201d level. The South End area, around the Boston Medical Center, is an area where statistically you are likely to be robbed at the same rate as its city center. Whilst the city center attracts significantly more people to it, BMC (Boston Medical Center) and its surrounding hospitals generate enough foot traffic, that it attracts both enough potential legitimate targets and motivated offenders, for it to create a hotspot. It is worth noting that some of those who commit robbery offenses may be visiting the hospital for legitimate reasons, and during the time they spend in and around the hospital, may find/spot offending opportunities. Such locations may also become areas of repeat victimization for those who work in these locations e.g., if you are a nurse, member of the maintenance team etc., you may regularly find yourself in the same location, at the same time, over, and over again. If there is a persistent offender who also finds that they share this space with you, because of their routine(s), the first time they victimize you may not be the last. Whilst too much emphasis is put on varying routes for safety etc., once you have been targeted it is worth attempting to avoid being in that location, at that time again. Once you have been victimized, changing routes and routines is worth doing; not so much as to appear \u201crandom\u201d but so as to avoid re-victimization.\nNext week\u2019s article will look at auto theft, how certain areas of Boston are hotspots for this type of offense, and how there are different hotspots for the theft of automobiles and motorbikes i.e., they are distinct and different. The article will also look at how theft and robbery differ by geography.\n\n\nCLICK TO GO BACK\n\nABOUT GERSHON BEN KEREN\nGershon Ben Keren is a 5th Degree Black Belt in Krav Maga, who received his teaching certifications in Israel.

We specialize in providing protective services in high crime areas such as Chinatown, Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan. We are the only armed entity in a school system in the city of Boston.

However, like any city, it has its share of dangerous neighborhoods. Here are some of the worst areas in Boston, based on crime rates:\nMost Dangerous Neighborhoods In Boston\n1. Central\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nCentral, an area in Boston, poses significant risks to its residents. With a crime rate of 5,452 incidents per 100,000 people, which is a stagg\u00adering 321% higher than the national average, it has gained notoriety as the most dangerous neighborhood in the city. Although property crimes are prevalent in Central, violent offenses also contr\u00adibute to their worrisome reput\u00adation.\n2. Roxbury\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nRoxbury is another one of Boston\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods. It has a total crime rate of 4,727 per 100,000 residents, 273% higher than the national average. Like Central, most of the crime in Roxbury is property crime, but violent crime is also a problem.\n3. Dorchester\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nDorch\u00adester, a large neighborhood in Boston, houses a population of over 130,000 residents. While the northern region of Dorch\u00adester remains relat\u00adively safe, the southern part stands out as one of the city\u2019s most dangerous areas. In fact, South Dorch\u00adester exhibits a stagg\u00adering total crime rate of 3,295 per 100,000 resid\u00adents\u2014a discon\u00adcerting statistic that exceeds the Massac\u00adhusetts state average by 142%.\n4. Mattapan\nMattapan, a small neighborhood in Boston, has an appro\u00adximate population of 30,000 people. It is recognized for its high crime rate, surpa\u00adssing the state average by 138% and exceeding Boston\u2019s average by 27%. Mattapan faces prevalent property crimes, including theft, car break-ins, and larce\u00adny.\n5. South End\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nThe South End, a trendy district in Boston, is home to numerous eateries and stores. While it offers various dining options and shopping experiences, it also harbors one of the city\u2019s most dangerous neighbo\u00adrhoods. With a total crime rate of 2,996 per 100,000 residents \u2013 exceeding the state average by 129% \u2013 certain sections of the South End are infamous for street-related crimes while others provide a safe haven suitable for families.\n6. North Dorchester\nDorch\u00adester, a city with around 130,000 resid\u00adents, is where almost one-fifth of all Bosto\u00adnians call home. Its total crime rate stands at 2,823 per 100,000 residents, which exceeds the state average by 121%.\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nBased on crime maps provided by the Dorch\u00adester Reporter, the more dangerous areas within Dorch\u00adester are situated west of Columbia Road. Criminal activity tends to be concen\u00adtrated around the vicinity of Blue Hill Avenue.\n7. Hyde Park\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nHyde Park, a neighborhood located in Boston\u2019s South End, has a total crime rate of 2,888 per 100,000 residents. This rate exceeds the state average by 124%. Despite this higher rate, Hyde Park is generally considered relat\u00adively safe with regard to violent crime. Most incidents in the area are property-related offenses like thefts and burgl\u00adaries, although assaults can occur.\n8. Jamaica Plain\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nJamaica Plain is generally considered to be a safe neighborhood in Boston. However, like any city, it has its share of crime. According to the Boston Police Department, the crime rate in Jamaica Plain is 1,852 per 100,000 residents, which is 21% lower than the national average. The majority of crime in Jamaica Plain is property crime, such as burglaries and thefts. Violent crime is also a problem but is less common than property crime.\n9. Back Bay-Beacon Hill\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nBack Bay-Beacon Hill is one of the bad areas of Boston. The crime rate here is 4,041 crimes per 100,000 residents, almost 140% higher than the state average. Living in Back Bay-Beacon Hill means you have a 1 in 25 chance of becoming a victim of crime.\n10. South Dorchester\nSouth Dorchester stands tall among the worst parts of Boston. According to Areavibes, the crime rate here is 40% higher than the national average, with the violent crime rate standing at 119% and the property crime rate 24% higher than the U.S. average.\n11. East Boston\nPhoto Credit: Canva\nEast Boston wraps up our list of bad areas of Boston. In terms of overall crime rate and property crime rate, the neighborhood is considered safe; however, the violent crime rate, standing at 8% higher than the national average, is a concern for the residents.\nIs South Boston Safe?\nSouth Boston is widely regarded as a secure neighborhood within the city. However, like any urban area, it does experience some criminal activity. The crime rate in South Boston stands at 1,728 incidents per 100,000 residents, which is approximately 15% lower than the national average.\nWhen considering safety levels within South Boston itself, the western and central parts of the neighborhood are considered to be the most secure areas. On the other hand, the southern and eastern sections of the neighborhood tend to have higher rates of crime.\nWorst Parts of Boston: Takeaway\nIt is important to note that these are just a few of the many dangerous neighborhoods in Boston. The crime rates in these neighborhoods can vary, so it is always best to do your research before moving to or visiting any neighborhood in Boston and consider consulting with a reputable moving company to ensure a secure and smooth transition.\nTrending\n10 Most Landlord Friendly States 2024\n10 Most Tenant Friendly States 2024\nNYC Local Law 11 \u2013 Complete Guide\nLetter Of No Objection In NYC Real Estate\n9 Common Basement Types: Which One Should You Choose?\nGeneral\nUnderstanding the Role of a Mortgage Broker in the Homebuying Process\nGeneral\nLien Theory vs Title Theory States: Understanding the Difference\nGeneral\nJudicial vs Non Judicial Foreclosure: What\u2019s The Difference?\nApartment\nWhat is an SRO NYC? \u2013 Ultimate Guide\nprev\nnext\nTOP APARTMENTS OF THE WEEK\nStudio apartment search in ny\none bedroom apartment\ntwo bedrooms apartments in nyc\nView More\nRENTALS\nNo Fee Rentals\nRenters Guide\nList Your Rental\nRoomate Search\n\n\nSALES\nBuyer Guide\nSeller Guide\nAvailability\nWant to sell your property?\nNYRENTOWNSELL\nAgents\nAbout Us\nCareers\nOffice Location\n\n\nDISCOVER\nMedia Housing\nRelocation\nFlexing\nBlog\nMOBILE APPS\n\u00a9 2019 Ny rent own sell 25 broadway 9 th floor, New York, NY 10038\n1-917-436-9219 | info@nyrentownsell.com\nDisclaimer\nSubscribe\nHomes for Sale\nHomes for Rent", "Sorry, you have been blocked\nYou are unable to access crimegrade.org\nWhy have I been blocked?\nThis website is using a security service to protect itself from online attacks.

While that may sound high, it\u2019s well below that of similar sized cities like DC and Baltimore and is less than half that of Dallas, but comparable to New York City (which is also generally a relatively safe city, believe it or not). As a major US city with a population of nearly 700K and the 10th largest metro area in the country, Boston is among the safest.\nThe lowest-crime neighborhood in Boston is West Roxbury which really doesn\u2019t even feel like it\u2019s in the city as it\u2019s a very suburban neighborhood with sizable, mostly single-family\nContinue Reading\nUpvote\nPromoted by monday.com\nmonday.com\nOne platform for managing any project, task, and workflow.\n \u00b7 \nUpdated Feb 18\nAre you also struggling with project deadlines?

U.S. Senior District Court Judge William G. Young scheduled sentencing for Sept. 24, 2024. McKinzie was arrested and charged in November 2022. \n\u201cEvery single person who considers paying to have sex with a minor better take notice \u2013 if you are caught you are facing at least a mandatory 10-year sentence in a federal prison. The reason people sell sex with little children is because there is demand for opportunities to engage in such morally reprehensible conduct. The only way to make progress in truly protecting kids from such predatory behavior is to both prosecute the men who traffic young girls and the men whose demand fuels this pernicious market,\u201d said Acting United States Attorney Joshua S. Levy. \n\u201cDimitri McKenzie was fully prepared to pay to sexually abuse someone he believed was a child. Instead of a child, he found himself face to face with an undercover HSI special agent and after today\u2019s verdict, he\u2019s facing serious federal prison time,\u201d said Michael J. Krol, Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New England. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible truth that there are predators ready and willing to pay to harm children. HSI is working every day with our partners to find these individuals and bring them to justice.\u201d\nIn November 2022, McKenzie responded to an online post purportedly advertising two minor girls \u2013 ages 12 and 14 years old \u2013 available to perform sex acts in exchange for money in the Boston area. The post was a fictious advertisement by undercover law enforcement. In subsequent text communications with undercover law enforcement, McKenzie agreed to pay $100 to have sex with the fictious 14-year-old minor at a local hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, McKenzie met with undercover law enforcement posing as the purported seller in the hotel parking lot, provided cash in exchange for 20 minutes with the fictitious minor and accepted a hotel key. McKenzie was immediately taken into custody. \nThe charge of attempted sex trafficking of a minor provides for a sentence of at least 10 years and up to life in prison, five years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case.\nIf you or someone you know may be impacted or experiencing commercial sex trafficking, please contact USAMA.VictimAssistance@usdoj.gov.\nActing U.S. Attorney Levy and HSI SAC Krol made the announcement today. Valuable assistance was provided by the Lexington, Waltham, Barnstable, Quincy and Cambridge Police Departments as well as the Massachusetts State Police and the Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s Office. Assistant U.S. Attorney Torey B. Cummings of the Civil Rights & Human Trafficking Unit and Assistant U.S. Attorney David G.

Peaseley was arrested on May 23, 2024 and released on conditions including a curfew, electronic location monitoring and an order not to have unsupervised contact with children.\n \nAccording to the charging documents, for approximately one year, Peaseley was involved in an online relationship with a 15-year-old minor, during which he allegedly discussed wanting to teach the minor how to kiss \u2013 among other sexually explicit activities \u2013 and his plan to visit the minor. Peaseley allegedly instructed the minor not to save his texts and suggested they should use a different platform. It is further alleged that Peaseley and the minor exchanged photographs which included sexually explicit photos of the minor. According to court documents, during a search of Peaseley\u2019s residence, approximately 243 images of CSAM were found on a computer and cellphone which were seized. \nPeaseley was formerly a teacher at the John D. O\u2019Bryant School of Mathematics and Science and the Match Charter School, both of which are in Boston.  \nThe charge of possession and receipt of child pornography provides for a mandatory minimum of five years in prison and maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, five years and up to a lifetime of supervised release, a fine of $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case.\nActing United States Attorney Joshua S.
